Advanced Programming Project - Time Series Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction

This project involves data extraction and analysis from global financial markets, focusing on commodities like gold, oil, and wheat. The goal is to perform time series analysis using Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy libraries, applying techniques such as:

1. Data Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess time series data, ensuring proper alignment and handling missing data, followed by normalizing and transforming for stationarity.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the time series data using Matplotlib.
3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensions while retaining the most relevant market trends, and interpret the results through scree plots and biplots.

Additionally, the project includes optimization through Linear Programming, where a company aims to maximize profit under production constraints over multiple periods, implemented in Python with SciPy.
